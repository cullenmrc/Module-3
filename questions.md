1.  Question 1:  Will all previous branches be deleted once a pull request review is complete and files are then merged back to master?  (I would like to keep and not delete all feedback provided in branches for students to reference in perpetuity)

Question 2:  While I love the Atom / GitHub integration, my students are given Chromebooks 1:1 in our District.  I am searching for a viable text editor that works with Chromebooks and GitHub.  Any recommendations?  I posed this question on the forum as well, however I haven't received any response to date.
